## Overview

The Transformer is a revolutionary neural network architecture based entirely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions. It has become the foundation for many state-of-the-art models in natural language processing, such as BERT, GPT, and T5.

This implementation includes:

-  **Multi-Head Attention** - Parallel attention layers for richer representations
-  **Positional Encoding** - Injecting sequence order information
-  **Encoder and Decoder Stacks** - The core architecture components
-  **Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks** - Per-position feature transformation
-  **Learning Rate Scheduler with Warmup** - Advanced optimization techniques
-  **Masking for Padding and Future Tokens** - Handling variable-length sequences

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For the machine translation example, install the spaCy language models:

```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
python -m spacy download de_core_news_sm
```

### Training

Train the Transformer on a toy sequence reversal task:

```bash
python train_transformer.py
```

### Visualizing Attention

Train a small Transformer and visualize its attention patterns:

```bash
python train_and_visualize.py
```

  <br>
  <i>Example of attention visualization. Generate your own by running train_and_visualize.py</i>
</p>

#### Generating Your Own Visualizations

To generate your own attention visualizations:

1. Run the visualization script:
   ```bash
   python train_and_visualize.py
   ```

2. The script will:
   - Train a small Transformer model
   - Extract attention weights from different layers and heads
   - Generate heatmap visualizations
   - Save them to the `images/` directory

3. You can modify the `train_and_visualize.py` script to customize:
   - The model size and training parameters
   - Which attention layers and heads to visualize
   - The visualization style and format

### Machine Translation

Run the machine translation example:

```bash
python machine_translation_example.py
```

## 🔍 Implementation Details

The implementation follows the paper closely with configurable hyperparameters:

| Component | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Model Dimension (d_model) | 512 | Size of embeddings throughout the model |
| Number of Attention Heads | 8 | Attention heads in multi-head attention |
| Feed-Forward Dimension | 2048 | Inner layer dimension of position-wise FFN |
| Number of Layers | 6 | Number of encoder/decoder blocks |
| Dropout Rate | 0.1 | Probability of dropping units for regularization |

</p>

Key concepts from the "Attention Is All You Need" paper:

1. **Self-Attention** - Allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when encoding each position.

2. **Multi-Head Attention** - Splits the attention mechanism into multiple heads, allowing the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces.

3. **Positional Encoding** - Since the Transformer doesn't use recurrence, positional encodings are added to embed the position information of tokens in the sequence.

4. **Scaled Dot-Product Attention** - Attention function used in the paper, defined as:
   ```
   Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / sqrt(d_k))V
   ```

5. **Residual Connections and Normalization** - Used to aid in training deeper networks.

The Transformer architecture can be used for various natural language processing tasks:

1. **Machine Translation** - Translating text from one language to another
2. **Text Summarization** - Generating concise summaries of longer texts
3. **Question Answering** - Providing answers to questions based on a given context
4. **Text Generation** - Creating coherent text based on a prompt or context
